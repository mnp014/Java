#### What is Loose Coupling?    
`Loose Coupling is a core principle in software design where components or classes are independent of each other, minimizing direct dependencies. In a loosely coupled system, changes in one component have minimal impact on others.`  

💡Simple Definition:  
`Loose coupling means that objects are connected, but know little about each other.  `

💡Example in Real Life:  
- A TV remote controls the TV, but it doesn’t know how the TV works internally.  
- You can change the TV model from same manufacturer, and the remote might still work (assuming basic compatibility).  

🧠 Why Loose Coupling Matters:  
  ✅ Easier to maintain and test  
  ✅ Reusable components  
  ✅ Improves flexibility and scalability  
  ✅ Reduces ripple effects from changes  

    
💡Loose Coupling in Spring:  
Spring achieves loose coupling using Dependency Injection (DI).  
Example:  
▶️ Without DI (Tightly Coupled)  
```java
public class Car {
    private Engine engine = new Engine(); // direct dependency
}
```
▶️ With DI (Loosely Coupled)
```java
public class Car {
    private final Engine engine;

    public Car(Engine engine) { // dependency injected
        this.engine = engine;
    }
}
```
 ⮞ `Car` doesn’t create an `Engine`. It just uses one that’s injected.  
 ⮞ Now you can easily inject a `PetrolEngine`, `DieselEngine`, or even a mock in tests.

     
💡Key Techniques to Achieve Loose Coupling:  
  ✅ Interfaces + Implementations  
  ✅ Dependency Injection (DI)  
  ✅ Event-driven communication  
  ✅ Service abstraction layers  
  ✅ Inversion of Control (IoC)

#### What is a Dependency?    
`A dependency in software development is anything that a piece of code (like a class, function, or module) relies on to work properly.`  

💡Simple Definition:  
`A dependency is another object or service that a class needs to function.`  

Example:  
```java
public class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    public Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }
}
```
Here:  
⮞ Car depends on Engine.  
⮞ So, Engine is a dependency of Car.  

🧠 Why Dependencies Matter:  
  ✅ They enable modular design — one class uses another without duplicating functionality.  
  ✅ But too many or hardcoded dependencies lead to tight coupling, making code hard to test or modify.  

💡Managing Dependencies:  
⮞ `Manually`: Creating and passing them yourself.  
⮞ Using `Dependency Injection (DI)`: Letting a `framework` like Spring manage and inject them.  
⮞ Using `Dependency Managers`: Like `Maven` or `Gradle`, which fetch libraries (external dependencies) your app needs.  

🗂️ Types of Dependencies:    
| Type         | Example                                      |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Internal     | Classes/objects within the app               |
| External     | Libraries like Apache Commons, Gson          |
| Runtime      | A database, file system, or service          |
| Compile-time | Other classes used directly in code          |

#### What is IOC (Inversion of Control)?    
`Inversion of Control (IoC) is a design principle where the control of creating and managing objects is transferred from your application code to a container or framework (like Spring).`

💡Simple Definition:  
`Instead of your code calling the library/framework, the framework calls your code and injects dependencies as needed.`

💡Example:  
▶️ In Traditional Code (No IoC):  
```java
public class Car {
    Engine engine = new Engine(); // You control object creation
}
```
Here, `Car` is responsible for creating its own `Engine` — this is tight coupling.  

▶️ With IoC in Spring:  
```java
@Component
public class Car {
    private final Engine engine;

    @Autowired
    public Car(Engine engine) { // Spring injects this
        this.engine = engine;
    }
}
```
⮞ Spring inverts the control: it creates the `Engine` and injects it into `Car`.  

💡 How Spring Implements IoC:  
Spring uses:  
  ✅ `IoC Container`: Like ApplicationContext  
  ✅ `Dependency Injection (DI)`: Constructor, setter, or field injection  
  ✅ `Bean lifecycle management`: Spring creates, configures, and manages beans  

 🎯 Benefits of IoC:  
➡️ Loose Coupling  
➡️ Easier Unit Testing  
➡️ Better Modular Code  
➡️ Simplifies Dependency Management  

📦 Real-world Analogy:  
Imagine a plug-in socket system:  
⮞ `Without IoC`: Your appliance must generate its own power.  
⮞ `With IoC`: The power comes from the wall (external source), and the appliance just plugs in.  


---
#### What is Dependency Injection?    
Dependency Injection (DI) is a `design pattern` and core part of Spring’s `Inversion of Control (IoC)` that lets you provide dependencies (like objects or services) to a class from the outside, rather than the class creating them itself.  

💡Simple Definition:   
`Instead of creating its own dependencies, a class receives them (injected) from an external source — usually a framework like Spring.`  

▶️ Without DI (Tightly Coupled):  
```java
public class Car {
    private Engine engine = new Engine(); // Car creates its own dependency
}
```
`Car` is tightly coupled to `Engine`. Hard to test, replace, or reuse.  
▶️ With DI (Loosely Coupled):  
```java
public class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    public Car(Engine engine) { // dependency is injected
        this.engine = engine;
    }
}
```
Now the `Car` doesn’t care how the `Engine` is made. It just uses what it’s given.

💡Spring makes DI easy:  
```java
@Component
public class Engine {}

@Component
public class Car {
    private final Engine engine;

    @Autowired
    public Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }
}
```

⮞ Spring scans `@Component` classes  
⮞ Creates the `Engine` bean  
⮞ Injects it into the `Car` bean automatically  

🗂️ Types of Dependency Injection:
| Type           | Example / Notes                                                                 |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Constructor DI | ✅ Recommended for immutability and required dependencies                        |
| Setter DI      | Useful for optional dependencies                                                 |
| Field DI       | Quick and easy, but harder to test (not recommended for complex apps)           |


🧠 Why DI is Awesome:  
  ✅ Promotes loose coupling  
  ✅ Improves testability (easy to inject mocks/stubs)  
  ✅ Makes code more flexible and maintainable  
  ✅ Centralizes object creation (managed by Spring container)

#### Can you give few examples of Dependency Injection?    
✅ Example 1: Constructor Injection (Recommended)  
```java
@Component
public class Engine {
    public String start() {
        return "Engine started!";
    }
}

@Component
public class Car {
    private final Engine engine;

    @Autowired // Optional since Spring 4.3+ if there's only one constructor
    public Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }

    public void drive() {
        System.out.println(engine.start());
    }
}
```
✅ Example 2: Setter Injection  
```java
@Component
public class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    @Autowired
    public void setEngine(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }

    public void drive() {
        System.out.println(engine.start());
    }
}
```
✅ Example 3: Field Injection (Not recommended for unit testing)  
```java
@Component
public class Car {
    @Autowired
    private Engine engine;

    public void drive() {
        System.out.println(engine.start());
    }
}
```
✅ Example 4: Using `@Qualifier` with Multiple Beans
```java
@Component("dieselEngine")
public class DieselEngine implements Engine {
    public String start() {
        return "Diesel engine started!";
    }
}

@Component("petrolEngine")
public class PetrolEngine implements Engine {
    public String start() {
        return "Petrol engine started!";
    }
}

@Component
public class Car {
    private final Engine engine;

    @Autowired
    public Car(@Qualifier("petrolEngine") Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }

    public void drive() {
        System.out.println(engine.start());
    }
}
```
✅ Example 5: Injecting External Dependency (e.g., from application.properties)
```properties
# application.properties
car.model=Toyota Supra
```
```java
@Component
public class Car {
    @Value("${car.model}")
    private String model;

    public void showModel() {
        System.out.println("Car model: " + model);
    }
}
```  
These examples demonstrate how Spring automatically injects dependencies and manages the lifecycle, helping you build loosely coupled, testable, and maintainable code.

#### How do you choose between `setter` and `constructor` injections?  

| Feature                      | Constructor Injection                                  | Setter Injection                                         |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 🔐 Immutability              | Promotes immutability (final fields)                  | Allows mutable state                                     |
| 🔎 Required Dependencies     | Enforces all required dependencies at creation time   | Dependencies can be optional                            |
| 💥 Null-Safety               | Safer — dependencies can't be null if constructor is called | Possible to forget setting a dependency             |
| 🧪 Testability               | Easy to write unit tests (explicit deps in constructor)| Testable, but requires setting values separately         |
| ♻️ Flexibility               | Less flexible — all args must be passed                | More flexible — can set different values at runtime      |
| ✅ Best Use Case             | For mandatory dependencies                             | For optional/configurable dependencies                   |

💡 Example: 
 ▶️ Constructor Injection Example (Recommended)  
 ```java
@Component
public class Car {
    private final Engine engine;

    @Autowired // optional since Spring 4.3 if only one constructor
    public Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }
}
```
⮞ Clear that `Engine` is required.  
⮞ `engine` can be made `final`.  
⮞ More `robust` for `long-term maintenance`.  

▶️ Setter Injection Example  
```java
@Component
public class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    @Autowired
    public void setEngine(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }
}
```
⮞ Useful when:  
1️⃣⮞ You have optional dependencies  
2️⃣⮞ You need to reconfigure a bean after instantiation  

---
#### What is Auto Wiring?    
Autowiring is a feature in Spring that automatically injects dependencies into a Spring bean without explicitly specifying them in the configuration. Spring uses Dependency Injection (DI) to do this behind the scenes.

💡Simple Definition:   
`Autowiring is Spring’s way of saying,`  
`“Hey, I’ll figure out what this bean needs and provide it for you — no need to manually wire it.”`  

💡Example:
```java
@Component
public class Engine {
    public String start() {
        return "Engine started!";
    }
}

@Component
public class Car {
    @Autowired
    private Engine engine;

    public void drive() {
        System.out.println(engine.start());
    }
}
```
⮞ `@Autowired` tells Spring to inject an instance of `Engine` into the `Car`.  
⮞ You don't need to use `new Engine()` anywhere. Spring handles that.  

💡 How Spring Performs Autowiring:  
⮞ Scans for `@Component` beans using `@ComponentScan`  
⮞ `Creates` and `manages` the beans in the `ApplicationContext`  
⮞ Looks at `@Autowired` `fields`/`constructors`/`setters`  
⮞ Finds `matching beans` by type  
⮞ `Injects` them automatically  


🗂️ Types of Dependency Injection:  
| Type         | Description                                                                 |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `byType`     | Injects by matching type (e.g., `Engine`)                                   |
| `byName`     | Injects by matching bean name (used in XML config)                          |
| `constructor`| Injects via constructor if only one exists or marked with `@Autowired`      |
| `no`         | Default in XML config (no autowiring)                                       |
| `autodetect` | *(Deprecated)* Chooses between constructor and `byType` automatically       |


💡 Benefits of Autowiring:  
  ✅ Reduces boilerplate code  
  ✅ Promotes loose coupling  
  ✅ Enables easier unit testing  
  ✅ Keeps code clean and maintainable

#### What are the important roles of an IOC Container?    
The IoC (Inversion of Control) Container is the core of the Spring Framework — it’s responsible for managing the lifecycle and configuration of application objects (beans).

📦 Important Roles of the IoC Container in Spring:  
| 🔢 | 📌 Role of IoC Container                       | 🔍 Description                                                                                   |
|----|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1️⃣ | Bean Creation                                 | Instantiates and manages Java objects (beans).                                                  |
| 2️⃣ | Dependency Injection                          | Automatically injects required dependencies into beans (constructor/setter/field injection).     |
| 3️⃣ | Bean Configuration                            | Reads metadata (XML, annotations, or Java config) to configure beans.                            |
| 4️⃣ | Bean Lifecycle Management                     | Controls the full lifecycle: creation, initialization, destruction.                              |
| 5️⃣ | Scope Management                              | Manages bean scopes: singleton, prototype, request, session, etc.                                |
| 6️⃣ | Event Publication                             | Publishes and listens for events via `ApplicationEventPublisher`.                                |
| 7️⃣ | Resource Loading                              | Provides utilities to access resources (like `.properties` files).                               |
| 8️⃣ | AOP Support                                   | Creates proxies for beans to enable AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming).                           |
| 9️⃣ | Internationalization (i18n)                   | Supports message resolution for multiple locales.                                                |
| 🔟 | Bean Post-Processors and Aware Interfaces      | Allows hooks before/after bean initialization and supports injecting context/environment directly into beans. |

📦 IoC Container Interfaces in Spring
| Interface          | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `BeanFactory`       | Basic container; supports lazy loading and simple DI.                       |
| `ApplicationContext`| Advanced container; builds on `BeanFactory` and adds support for AOP, i18n, events, etc. |

Common implementations:  
⮞ `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext`  
⮞ `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext`  
⮞ `GenericApplicationContext` (more flexible)  

🔄 Lifecycle of a Bean in IoC Container:  
1️⃣⮞ Read Configuration (XML, annotations, or Java classes)  
2️⃣⮞ Instantiate Beans  
3️⃣⮞ Inject Dependencies  
4️⃣⮞ Call Aware Interfaces  
5️⃣⮞ Apply Bean PostProcessors  
6️⃣⮞ Call Initialization Methods  
7️⃣⮞ Bean is Ready for Use  
8️⃣⮞ Call Destroy Methods on Shutdown

#### What are Bean Factory and Application Context?   
🏭 1. BeanFactory   
`BeanFactory` is the most basic Spring IoC container. It provides the fundamental features for managing beans, such as:  
| Aspect             | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 📦 Interface        | `org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanFactory`                             |
| 🎯 Primary Feature  | Lazy-loading of beans (created only when needed)                            |
| 🔧 Configuration    | XML-based or manual                                                         |
| ⚙️ Use Case         | Lightweight applications, testing, or memory-sensitive apps                 |
| ❌ Limitations      | No support for advanced features like AOP, events, or i18n                  |

💡  Example (Old Style):  
```java
BeanFactory factory = new XmlBeanFactory(new FileSystemResource("beans.xml"));
MyBean myBean = factory.getBean("myBean", MyBean.class);
```
🔻 `XmlBeanFactory` is deprecated — replaced by ApplicationContext.

🌐 2. ApplicationContext  
`ApplicationContext` is the more powerful and preferred container in Spring. It extends BeanFactory and provides many enterprise-level features.  
| Aspect                  | Description                                                        |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 📦 Interface            | `org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext`                   |
| ⚙️ Features              | Everything `BeanFactory` offers plus:                              |
| ✅ AOP Support          | Yes                                                                |
| ✅ Event Publishing     | Yes (`ApplicationEventPublisher`)                                  |
| ✅ i18n Support         | Yes                                                                |
| ✅ Bean PostProcessors  | Auto-detected                                                      |
| ✅ Environment Abstraction | Yes                                                            |
| ✅ Eager Loading        | Beans are created at startup (by default)                          |

💡 Example (Modern Usage):  
```java
ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("beans.xml");
MyBean myBean = context.getBean(MyBean.class);
```
Or, using annotations:  
```java
ApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class);
```
💡 Key Differences Summary:  
| Feature                   | `BeanFactory`             | `ApplicationContext`           |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Bean Instantiation        | Lazy (on demand)          | Eager (at startup)              |
| Event Handling            | ❌ Not supported           | ✅ Supported                    |
| AOP Integration           | ❌ Manual                  | ✅ Automatic                    |
| MessageSource (i18n)      | ❌ Not supported           | ✅ Supported                    |
| Bean Post Processors      | ❌ Manual registration     | ✅ Auto-detected                |
| Web Application Support   | ❌ Limited                 | ✅ Full support                 |

Sumary:|
- BeanFactory is the bare minimum, suitable for simple scenarios or unit tests.  
- ApplicationContext is a superset, providing more advanced features like:  
-- internationalization,  
-- event publishing,  
-- AOP integration,  
-- environment abstraction,  
-- convenient integration with Spring Boot.  
For most real-world applications, especially Spring Boot ones, ApplicationContext is preferred.  

---
#### How do you create an application context with Spring?    
 - You can create an ApplicationContext in Spring in multiple ways, depending on whether you're using XML-based, annotation-based, or Java-based configuration.  
   1. Using Annotation-based Configuration (Recommended for modern Spring apps)  
      ```java
      @Configuration
      @ComponentScan("com.example")
      public class AppConfig {
          // Bean definitions (if any)
      }

      // Create context
      ApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class);
      MyBean myBean = context.getBean(MyBean.class);
      ```
      Make sure to annotate your classes with @Component, @Service, @Repository, or @Controller to be picked up by component scanning.
   2. Using XML-based Configuration
      ```xml
      <beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
           xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
           xsi:schemaLocation="
              http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
              http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

          <bean id="myBean" class="com.example.MyBean" />
      </beans>
      ```
      ```java
      ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("beans.xml");
      MyBean myBean = (MyBean) context.getBean("myBean");
      ```
   3. Using Spring Boot (auto-configures ApplicationContext)
      ```java
      @SpringBootApplication
      public class MyApp {
          public static void main(String[] args) {
              ApplicationContext context = SpringApplication.run(MyApp.class, args);
              MyBean myBean = context.getBean(MyBean.class);
          }
      }
      ```
   4. Using GenericApplicationContext (manual control)
      ```java
      GenericApplicationContext context = new GenericApplicationContext();
      context.registerBean(MyBean.class);
      context.refresh();
      MyBean myBean = context.getBean(MyBean.class);
      ```
Make sure to annotate your classes with @Component, @Service, @Repository, or @Controller to be picked up by component scanning.  

---
#### How does Spring know where to search for Components or Beans?    
✅ 1. Using `@ComponentScan` Annotation (Java Config)  
In annotation-based configuration, Spring uses @ComponentScan to specify the base packages it should scan for beans.  
```java
@Configuration
@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.example.myapp")
public class AppConfig {
}
```
⮞ Spring will scan the package com.example.myapp and all its sub-packages for annotated components.  
⮞ Without explicitly specifying, it scans the package of the configuration class by default.  

✅ 2. Using `@SpringBootApplication` (Spring Boot)  
If you're using Spring Boot, the main class has:  
```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class MyApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MyApp.class, args);
    }
}
```
⮞ `@SpringBootApplication` includes `@ComponentScan` by default:  
```java
@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.example") // implicit
```
So Spring will scan the package of this class and its sub-packages.  
🟦 `Best practice`: Put your main class in the root package to scan everything below.  

✅ 3. Using XML Configuration (Old Style)  
```xml
<context:component-scan base-package="com.example.myapp"/>
```
⮞ This tells Spring to scan that package for beans.

🔍 What is Spring looking for?  
⮞ Spring scans for classes annotated with:  
| Annotation       | Purpose                                               |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `@Component`     | Generic Spring-managed bean                           |
| `@Service`       | Business logic service class                          |
| `@Repository`    | DAO layer bean (with exception translation)           |
| `@Controller`    | MVC controller                                        |
| `@RestController`| REST API controller                                   |  

⮞ All of the above are detected during component scanning.  

📦 TL;DR:
Spring knows where to look because of `@ComponentScan` or `@SpringBootApplication`. It scans the `specified package` and its `sub-packages` for `annotated beans`.

#### What is a Component Scan?    
#### How do you define a component scan in XML and Java Configurations?    
#### How is it done with Spring Boot?    

Component Scan is a Spring feature that automatically detects and registers beans (classes annotated with @Component, @Service, @Repository, or @Controller) into the Spring IoC container at runtime — so you don’t have to define each bean manually.

💡Simple Definition:  
`Component Scan tells Spring:`  
`“Hey, go look inside this package and find any classes that should be turned into beans.”`  

💡How it Works  
When Spring starts up:  
1️⃣⮞ It reads your configuration (@Configuration, @SpringBootApplication, or XML).  
2️⃣⮞ It looks at the @ComponentScan directive.  
3️⃣⮞ It scans the specified packages and subpackages.  
4️⃣⮞ Finds classes with bean-related annotations.  
5️⃣⮞ Registers them as Spring-managed beans.  

 Common Annotations Detected During Component Scanning  
| Annotation        | Purpose                                           |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `@Component`      | Generic component                                 |
| `@Service`        | Business logic layer                              |
| `@Repository`     | Data access layer (with exception translation)    |
| `@Controller`     | MVC controller                                    |
| `@RestController` | REST controller                                   |  

All of these are just stereotypes of `@Component`, so Spring can pick them up.  

💡Where to Declare Component Scanning?   
✅ Java-based Configuration:    
```java
@Configuration
@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.example.myapp")
public class AppConfig {
}
```

✅ Spring Boot (Auto Component Scan):  
```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class MyApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MyApp.class, args);
    }
}
```
⮞ `@SpringBootApplication` includes `@ComponentScan` automatically.  
⮞ It scans the package where this class is defined and all its sub-packages.  

✅ XML Configuration:  
```xml
<context:component-scan base-package="com.example.myapp"/>
```
💡 Best Practices  
⮞ Keep your main application class in the root package.  
⮞ Keep related components grouped logically in sub-packages.  
⮞ Use specific `basePackages` if you want tighter control over what gets scanned.  

💡 Example:  
```java
// Scanned automatically
@Component
public class Engine {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Engine started!");
    }
}
```
```java
@Component
public class Car {
    @Autowired
    private Engine engine;

    public void drive() {
        engine.start();
    }
}
```
⮞ As long as both are in a scanned package, you don’t need to define them manually in any config.  


---
#### What does @Component signify?    
`@Component` is a Spring annotation that marks a Java class as a `Spring-managed` bean. It tells Spring,  
“Hey, this class is a candidate to be automatically detected and added to the IoC container.”  

💡Simple Definition:   
`@Component = "Make this class a bean, and let Spring handle its lifecycle."`

💡Example:  
```java
@Component
public class Engine {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Engine started!");
    }
}
```
If this class is in a package scanned by Spring (via `@ComponentScan` or `@SpringBootApplication`), Spring will:  
⮞ Automatically create an instance of Engine  
⮞ Register it in the ApplicationContext  
⮞ Make it available for autowiring in other components  

Behind the Scenes   
⮞ `@Component` is a stereotype annotation.   
⮞ It’s a specialization of `@Bean`, but used for automatic scanning (whereas `@Bean` is manual).  
⮞ All stereotype annotations like `@Service`, `@Repository`, and `@Controller` are meta-annotated with @Component.   

📌 Common Stereotypes Built on `@Component`:  
| Annotation        | Usage                                                             |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `@Component`      | Generic component                                                 |
| `@Service`        | Business/service layer                                            |
| `@Repository`     | DAO/persistence layer                                             |
| `@Controller`     | Web layer (MVC)                                                   |
| `@RestController` | REST API controller (`@Controller` + `@ResponseBody`)             |

⮞ These are more semantic — they behave the same as `@Component`, but make code more meaningful.

⚠️ Important Note:  
⮞ `@Component` alone doesn’t create the object unless:  
1️⃣⮞ The class is in a package being scanned.  
2️⃣⮞ You have enabled component scanning using `@ComponentScan` or `@SpringBootApplication`.  

🧪 In Practice:  
⮞ Spring handles the injection automatically. You never need to say `new Engine()` anywhere.  
```java
@Component
public class Engine {}

@Component
public class Car {
    @Autowired
    private Engine engine;

    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("Car is driving...");
        engine.start();
    }
}
```


---
#### What does @Autowired signify?    
`@Autowired` is a Spring annotation used to automatically inject dependencies into a Spring-managed bean.  
It tells Spring:  
`“Please find a matching bean in the container and inject it here.”`  

💡Simple Definition:   
`@Autowired = "Let Spring handle wiring this dependency for me."`

💡Example:  
```java
@Component
public class Engine {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Engine started!");
    }
}

@Component
public class Car {

    @Autowired
    private Engine engine;

    public void drive() {
        engine.start();
    }
}
```

⮞ Spring sees `@Autowired` on the engine field.  
⮞ It looks in the `ApplicationContext` for a bean of type `Engine`.  
⮞ Finds one, and injects it automatically.  

💡Where You Can Use `@Autowired`:  
| Usage Location                               | Example                                              |
|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Field (common)                               | `@Autowired private Engine engine;`                  |
| Constructor (recommended for required dependencies) | `@Autowired public Car(Engine engine)`              |
| Setter (useful for optional dependencies)    | `@Autowired public void setEngine(Engine engine)`    |

💡 Constructor Injection (Preferred Style):  
```java
@Component
public class Car {
    private final Engine engine;

    @Autowired  // optional since Spring 4.3+ if only one constructor
    public Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }
}
```

🧠 What Happens Behind the Scenes?  
⮞ `@Autowired` is handled by `AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor`.  
⮞ At runtime, Spring inspects the class and tries to inject dependencies:  
1️⃣⮞ By type (default behavior)  
2️⃣⮞ Throws `NoSuchBeanDefinitionException` if no match is found  
3️⃣⮞ Throws `NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException` if multiple matches are found  


Handling Multiple Beans  
```java
@Autowired
@Qualifier("dieselEngine")
private Engine engine;
```
Use `@Qualifier` to tell Spring which bean to inject when multiple candidates exist.  

⚠️ Optional Dependencies  
```java
@Autowired(required = false)
private TurboCharger turbo;
```
If no bean of type `TurboCharger` is found, Spring won’t fail — it will leave it `null`.  

💡 Benefits of @Autowired:  
✅ Promotes loose coupling  
✅ Reduces boilerplate code  
✅ Makes testing and mocking easier  
✅ Integrates seamlessly with Spring's IoC container

#### What’s the difference Between @Controller, @Component, @Repository, and @Service Annotations in Spring?    
🧩 All of them are specializations of @Component  

| Annotation        | Purpose                              | Layer it Represents     | Special Behavior                                                                 |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `@Component`      | Generic Spring-managed component      | Any (utility/helper)     | None                                                                             |
| `@Service`        | Business logic layer                  | Service Layer            | None (semantic indication of service responsibility)                            |
| `@Repository`     | Data access layer (DAO)               | Persistence Layer        | Exception translation (wraps DB exceptions into Spring’s `DataAccessException`) |
| `@Controller`     | Handles HTTP requests                 | Web Layer (MVC)          | Maps web requests via `@RequestMapping`, `@GetMapping`, etc.                    |
| `@RestController` | `@Controller` + `@ResponseBody` combo | RESTful Web Layer        | Returns JSON/XML directly instead of rendering a view                           |

💡 In Depth:  
✅ `@Component`  
⮞ The base annotation for Spring-managed beans.  
⮞ Use it when no specific role fits.  
```java
@Component
public class UtilityHelper {
    // helper methods
}
```
✅ `@Service`  
⮞ Marks a service class containing business logic.  
⮞ Helps with semantic clarity.  
```java
@Service
public class PaymentService {
    public void processPayment() {
        // business logic
    }
}
```
✅ `@Repository`  
⮞ Marks a DAO (Data Access Object) class.  
⮞ Spring adds exception translation: converts SQLException to DataAccessException.  
```java
@Repository
public class UserRepository {
    public void save(User user) {
        // DB interaction
    }
}
```
✅ `@Controller`  
⮞ Marks a web controller in Spring MVC.  
⮞ Maps web requests to handler methods.  
```java
@Controller
public class HomeController {
    
    @GetMapping("/")
    public String home() {
        return "index"; // resolves to a view name
    }
}
```
✅ `@RestController`  
⮞ Shortcut for `@Controller` + `@ResponseBody`.  
⮞ Suitable for REST APIs.  
```java
@RestController
public class ApiController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello, JSON!";
    }
}
```

🎯 Summary Table:  
| Annotation        | Bean Type        | Typical Usage         | Additional Features                                  |
|-------------------|------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `@Component`      | Generic bean      | Utility/helper class   | None                                                 |
| `@Service`        | Service bean      | Business logic         | None                                                 |
| `@Repository`     | DAO bean          | DB access              | Exception translation (to Spring's `DataAccessException`) |
| `@Controller`     | Web controller    | MVC controllers        | Request mapping via `@RequestMapping`, etc.         |
| `@RestController` | REST controller   | REST API endpoints     | Auto JSON/XML response via `@ResponseBody`          |

⚠️ Reminder:  
All of these work only if they are in a package scanned by Spring (`@ComponentScan` or `@SpringBootApplication`).

#### What are the different scopes of a bean?    
| Scope        | Description                                                      |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `singleton` (default) | One shared instance per Spring container                         |
| `prototype`           | A new instance every time it’s requested                         |
| `request`             | One instance per HTTP request (Web apps only)                    |
| `session`             | One instance per HTTP session                                    |
| `application`         | One instance per `ServletContext`                                |
| `websocket`           | One instance per WebSocket session (for WebSocket-based apps)    |


---
#### What is the default scope of a bean?     
✅ singleton   

---
#### What does `singleton` mean in Spring?    
⮞ Spring creates only one instance of the bean per Spring IoC container.  
⮞ The same instance is shared across the entire application wherever it's injected.  

💡 Example:   
```java
@Component
public class MyBean {
}
```
⮞ Even if you inject `MyBean` into multiple classes:
```java
@Autowired
private MyBean bean1;

@Autowired
private MyBean bean2;
```
⮞ Both `bean1` and `bean2` refer to the same object.

⚠️ Remember:  
Singleton in Spring ≠ Singleton Design Pattern  
⮞ Spring singleton = 1 per `container` (not per JVM).  
⮞ Java singleton pattern = 1 per `JVM` using private constructor and static instance.  

---
#### How to Change the Scope?  
```java
@Component
@Scope("prototype")
public class MyBean {
}
```
or
```xml
<bean id="myBean" class="com.example.MyBean" scope="prototype"/>
```

---
#### Are Spring beans thread safe?    
❌ By default, Spring beans are not thread-safe.  
Spring does not guarantee thread safety for beans, even though it creates singleton beans by default.  

🧠 Why?  
⮞ A Spring singleton bean means one instance per Spring container, not one thread.  
⮞ If multiple threads access a bean and the bean maintains state (mutable fields), race conditions and data corruption can happen.  

💡 Example (Not Thread-Safe):  
```java
@Component
public class CounterService {
    private int counter = 0;

    public void increment() {
        counter++;
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return counter;
    }
}
```
⮞ If accessed by multiple threads (e.g., web requests), counter++ can cause race conditions because ++ is not atomic.   

✅ Ways to Make Spring Beans Thread-Safe:  
| Solution                          | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Stateless design (preferred)      | Avoid shared mutable state — use local variables instead of fields.         |
| Synchronized methods/blocks       | Makes access to shared resources thread-safe, but can reduce performance.   |
| `ThreadLocal`                     | Keeps separate copies of variables for each thread.                         |
| Prototype scope                   | New bean instance per injection/request.                                    |
| Immutable objects                 | Design your bean to be immutable — no setters, use final fields.            |
| Concurrent collections/atomic types | Use `ConcurrentHashMap`, `AtomicInteger`, etc., for shared data.          |

📌 Best Practice:  
Design Spring beans to be stateless and let Spring handle state elsewhere, like:  
⮞ In the request/session scope (if needed)  
⮞ In a thread-safe service or data store

#### How is Spring’s singleton bean different from Gang of Four Singleton Pattern?    
| Feature         | Spring Singleton                                              | GoF Singleton Pattern                                               |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🔁 Scope         | One instance per Spring IoC container                          | One instance per JVM                                                |
| ⚙️ Managed By     | Spring Framework                                               | You (manual implementation in code)                                 |
| 🧱 Creation       | Created and managed by Spring during container initialization | Created manually using private constructor and static method        |
| 🔒 Thread Safety  | Not guaranteed by default                                     | Thread safety must be manually ensured                              |
| 🧪 Testability    | Easier to mock and test                                       | Harder to test due to tight coupling and static access              |
| 🔄 Flexibility    | Easily swapped/overridden via config or profiles              | Fixed; hard to extend or change                                     |
| 🧰 Usage          | Use `@Component` or `@Bean` (with default scope)              | Use static `getInstance()` method in class                          |

💡 Example:  
▶️ GoF Singleton Pattern Example (Manual)  
```java
public class MySingleton {
    private static final MySingleton INSTANCE = new MySingleton();

    private MySingleton() {}

    public static MySingleton getInstance() {
        return INSTANCE;
    }
}
```
▶️ Spring Singleton Example (Framework-managed)  
```java
@Component
public class MyService {
    // Spring ensures one instance per container
}
```
⮞ Spring handles the `lifecycle`, `dependencies`, and `injection` — no static access needed.  

🎯 Key Takeaway:  
⮞ Spring Singleton = Scoped to `container`.  
⮞ GoF Singleton = Global static instance per `JVM`.  
⮞ ✅ Use `Spring Singleton` for beans when working inside a Spring application.  
⮞ ❌ Avoid `manual singleton pattern` (GoF) in `Spring` apps — it fights against DI and testability.

#### How does Spring do Autowiring?  
Autowiring in Spring is how the framework automatically injects dependencies into a bean, without needing to explicitly specify them in configuration. It’s part of dependency injection (DI) and helps in reducing boilerplate code.

Spring uses reflection and the ApplicationContext to:
1. Scan and register beans (if component scanning is enabled).
2. Resolve dependencies by type (and optionally by name).
3. Inject the matching beans into dependent components during initialization.

Ways to Autowire in Spring
1. Using @Autowired Annotation
```java
   @Component
   public class Car {
      @Autowired
      private Engine engine;
   }
```

- Injects `Engine` bean into `Car`.
- Done by type (`Engine.class`).
- Can also be applied to constructors, setters, or fields.

 2. Constructor Injection (Recommended)
```java
    @Component
    public class Car {
        private final Engine engine;

        @Autowired
        public Car(Engine engine) {
            this.engine = engine;
        }
    }
```
- Immutable.
- Great for unit testing.
- Ensures dependencies are provided at creation time.
  
3.  Setter Injection
```java
@Component
public class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    @Autowired
    public void setEngine(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }
}
```

4. Autowiring Modes in XML Config (Deprecated style)
```xml
   <bean id="car" class="com.example.Car" autowire="byType"/>
```
  
   Modes:  
    - `no` (default)  
    - `byName`  
    - `byType`  
    - `constructor`  
    - `autodetect` (deprecated)  

  
Internals (Behind the Scenes):  
 - During context startup, Spring scans for annotated classes if component scanning is used.  
 - Spring resolves all dependencies using the `BeanFactory`.  
 - The `AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor` is triggered, which:  
 -- Finds fields/methods/constructors with `@Autowired`.  
 -- Injects appropriate beans from the context.  
 - If multiple candidates exist, Spring uses:  
 -- `@Qualifier` to specify the exact one.  
 -- `@Primary` if one bean is marked as preferred.  
  
Common Gotchas:  
 - If multiple beans of the same type exist: you'll get NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException unless:  
 -- You use @Qualifier("beanName")  
 -- One bean is marked @Primary  
 - If no bean of required type exists and required=true (default), you'll get NoSuchBeanDefinitionException.
